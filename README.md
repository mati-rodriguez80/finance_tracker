# STOCK TRACKER SOCIAL MEDIA APP

This web application is built while doing "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" on Udemy. The goal with this app is to learn some of the next topics which are different from previous apps:

* Use (and customization) of devise gem for authentication
* Ajax for form submission, in-depth
* Working with an external API to get stock quote information
* Working with sensitive credentials (such as API keys) within the app
* Faster development of resources using generators
* Bootstrap installation and usage for front-end styling without the use of the bootstrap gem

## Requirements for this app

* Authentication system, users can sign-up, edit their profile, login/logout
* Users can track stocks, up to 10 per user. Their profile page will display all the stocks they are tracking with their current price
* Users can search for stocks, add and remove stocks from their portfolio
* Users can look for friends, or other users of the app, by name or email
* Users can view the portfolio of stocks their friends are tracking for investing ideas
* The app must be mobile friendly, so styling has to be responsive

## General Information

* Ruby version: 2.7.5
* Rails version: 6.1.5.1
* Bootstrap version: 4.6.1
* Status: In Development
